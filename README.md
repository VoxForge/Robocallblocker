# Robocallblocker
Configurations for OBI110 and FreePBX/Asterisk block landline robocallers.
 
Found an old OBI110 I had purchased a few years ago and finally got around to setting it up to communicate with FreePBX on an old HP mini netbook.  Can now send predictive dialers to Spam voice mail box, and send whitelist to our landline phones.
