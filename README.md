# Robocallblocker (work in progress)
Configurations for OBI110 and FreePBX/Asterisk block landline robocallers.
 
We have an old-school landline phone for home use and have been getting many SPAM calls. This is an approach to blocking those calls using an OBI110 [ATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_telephone_adapter) and [FreePBX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreePBX).  

It simply asks callers to press a key, and if they do, it then transfers the call to our regular [landline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landline) phone.  If no one answers, it sends the call to a good voice mail extension.  If they don't press a key, it sends the call to a SPAM voice mail.  A whitelist allows known callers bypass the IVR Spam filter altogether and ring your phone directly.

The ATA used in this document is an old OBI110 I had purchased a few years ago and finally got around to setting up to communicate with FreePBX on an old HP mini netbook.

***OBIHAI OBI110 - setting up basic communications between OBI110 and FreePBX***

This document assumes that you have your OBI110 connected to your network and telephone jack, and have installed [FreePBX 14 (with version 13 of Asterisk)](https://www.freepbx.org/downloads/) on a dedicated computer, which is connected to the same network as the OBI110.  

The OBI110 ip address is assumed to be 192.168.1.13, FreePBX is at 192.168.1.11, and your router is at 192.168.1.1.  Change this to reflect your network settings.  This document also assumes that your home phone number is 555-555-1234 - change this to your phone number.


**1. OBI110 Network Settings**

*Internet Settings*

	IPAddress	192.168.1.13 (requires static ip address)
	SubnetMask	255.255.255.0
	DefaultGateway	192.168.1.1 (ip address of your router)
	DNSServer1	192.168.1.1

***2. Configure Line Port***

Connection from wall telephone jack (rj11) to OBI110 to FreePBX [trunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunking).  

The [RJ11 jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack) is connected via a standard telephone cable to OBI110.  The OBI110 is then connected to your home LAN using Ethernet cable so that it can connect to your FreePBX server.

**3.e. FREEPBX Outbound Routes**

Your landline phone now has a route to the FreePBX server.  

To actually connect to FreePBX from your phone (via OBI110) you need to dial '**1'.  You can do this now.  

From here you can dial 300 to get the extension we create and leave a voice mail. 

Or, if you want to call someone as you normally would on a telephone, we need to tell FreePBX how to do this.  One way is to create a dial code that tells FreePBX to send your keypresses to the PSTN (Public Service Telephone Network).  This is how we create that code.

Connectivity > Outbound Routes

	Route Settings
		Route: 81DialsPOTS
		Trunk Sequence for Matched Routes: OBITRUNK1
		
	Dial Patterns
	
		81|
		81|1NXXNXXXXXX
		81|NXXNXXXXXX
		81|NXXXXXX
		81|X11
		
	Import/Export Patterns - not applicable
	
	Additional Settings - defaults

(POTS = Plain Old Telephone Service = PSNT)

***4. Whitelisting***

The Inbound Route on FreePBX decides what happens when someone calls your phone.  As part of the initial set up, we told FreePBX to send the call to extension 300, and since your phone is linked to this extension through OBI110, any call coming in will ring on your landline phone.

What can we do to prevent robo calls from making your phone ring?  

Spam callers usually use a [predictive dialer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_dialer) to connect you to their spam agent.  What happens is that the Robocaller calls many nuumbers, and if someone answers, proceeds to try to match them with an available attendant.  But the robocallers are dumb, and if you ask them to press a digit, they cannot (not yet at least - voice spammers are beginning to use speech recogniion, more on that later...).

Therefore, to prevent roboCallers, you need require anyone calling you to dial 8 before allowing the call to go through.  We can use the FreePBX IVR app to do this.

**4.a Record caller prompts**

First, we need to record our the messages we want the caller to hear.

Using an Audio recording app (such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)), record the following phrase:

	Hello, you've reached 555 555 1234, please press 8 to continue

and save it as a wav file named:

	greetingAndPressToContinue.wav

(note: if your browser supports it, you can record your prompt in your browser when adding a new recording - see: Admin > System Recordings, then 'Record in Browser')

**4.b Upload recording to FreePBX**

Next upload your wavefile to FreePBX

	Admin > System Recordings

Add New System Recording

	Name			greetingAndPressToContinue.wav
	Description		greeting and press key to Continue
	Upload Recording

**4.c Setup IVR**

on FreePBX: Application > IVR

	IVR Name 		PressToContinue

**5. Troubleshooting**

FreePBX uses [fail2ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban). If as you are setting up FreePBX and logging on and logging off you get locked out for no apparent reason, it is likely you have been caught by fail2ban.  

Go to Admin > System Admin

select: Intrusion Detection

Add the ip address of the computer you are using to remotely access the FreePBX server to the Whitelist section (you may have to do this from a different computer, or restart FreePBX - note you only have a minute or two before fail2ban blocks your ip address again).

Submit your change.


**5. Direct Outbound Calling**
Default OBI110 outbound call routes send you through FreePBX and then you must use the previouls configure FreePBX outbound route to call as you normally would.  So to make a call to the [PSTN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network), you need to:

	a. press **1 (to access FreePBX )
	b. press 81# (to access pstn)
	c. dial your number

Another option in the default OBI110 outbound call routes is to:

	a. press **8 (to connect to line port on OBI110, bypassing FreePBX altogether)
	b. dial your number

Since we are not using SIP calling, we don't really need FreePBX for outbound calls, so lets find a more direct way to bypass FreePBX and make calls without having to press **8...

***DigitMap and OutboundCallRoute - Defaults***

	DigitMap: ([1-9]x?*(Mpli)|[1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|911|**0|***|#|**1(Msp1)|**2(Msp2)|**8(Mli)|**9(Mpp)|(Mpli))
	
	OutboundCallRoute: {([1-9]x?*(Mpli)):pp},{(<#:>|911):li},{**0:aa},{***:aa2},{(<**1:>(Msp1)):sp1},{(<**2:>(Msp2)):sp2},{(<**8:>(Mli)):li},{(<**9:>(Mpp)):pp},{(Mpli):pli}

****Understanding the Defaults****

****DigitMap****

A digit map can be used to perform the following tasks:

	• Ensure a complete number is dialed
	• Transform dialed digits
	• Block numbers from being dialed
	
****Outbound Call Routes****

We use a digit map to match or transform a number [...] that’s been entered. Once the digit map has matched the entered sequence, we can then use the outbound call route to direct the call to the correct terminal on the OBi. The outbound call route directs the call from the perspective of the user placing the call from the OBi device.

****Terminals on the OBi****

Each physical connection [...] on the OBi device is addressed as a logical
terminal by the software.  OBi devices support the following terminals:

	Phone (FXS) Ports - ph1
	Line (FXO) Ports - ln1
	IP Voice Services - sp1, sp2
	...

[source: Obi DigitMap CallRoute Tutorial](http://www.obitalk.com/forum/index.php?OBTKSID=9nhu8corvcoalmgq7q38umiso5&action=dlattach;topic=9104.0;attach=878)

****OutboundCallRoute - Review****

Each route in a terminal's OutboundCallRoute is seperated by a comma. Lets break them out and analyze each in turn:

*****{([1-9]x?&#42;(Mpli)):pp}*****

	This route is not required because it routes to pp, which is used for Obi to Obi calls, and therefore can be deleted.

****{(<#:>|911):li}****

	If the caller dials #911 or 911, then route call directly to Line Port

****{&#42;&#42;0:aa}****

	If the caller dials **0, then route call directly Obi110 Auto Attendant

****{&#42;&#42;&#42;:aa2}****

	If the caller dials ***, then route call directly Obi110 Device Configuration Menu	

****{(<&#42;&#42;1:>(Msp1)):sp1}****

	If the caller dials **1, then connect call to FreePBX (to listen to voice mail, etc)
	
****{(<&#42;&#42;2:>(Msp2)):sp2}****

	not used, delete

****{(<&#42;&#42;8:>(Mli)):li}****

	If the caller dials **8, then bypass FreePBX, and make a call as you normally would on PSTN.

****{(<&#42;&#42;9:>(Mpp)):pp}****

	routes to pp, which is used for Obi to Obi calls, and therefore can be deleted.

****{(Mpli):pli}****
	
	This route is not required because it routes to pli, which is the primary line which corresponds to SP1 Service, and since we are not using VoIP calling, we can be delete it.
	
Therefore, to be able to dial a number as one would on a regular phone, bypasing FreePBX, we need add a route that goes directly to the OBI110 Line Port:

****{(Mli):li}****

(Mli): (M = Embedded Digit Map; li = Line)
	Note that this references the Digitmap for the Line Port (your telephone jack), whose default Digitmap is as follows:
	
	(xxxxxxxS4|1xxxxxxxxxx|xx.)

Lets change this so that it will accept 10 digit calls (7 digit call prefixed by 3 digit area code for local calls), and add some spaces for readability (which is allowed in OBi110):

	([2-9]xx xxx xxxxS2|1 xxx xxx xxxx|xx.)

Therefore the final DigitMap for the Phone terminal should look like this:

	{{(<#:>|911):li},{**0:aa},{***:aa2},{(<**1:>(Msp1)):sp1},{(<**8:>(Mli)):li},{(Mli1):li1}}
