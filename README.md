# Robocallblocker (work in progress)
Configurations for OBI110 and FreePBX/Asterisk block landline robocallers.
 
Found an old OBI110 I had purchased a few years ago and finally got around to setting it up to communicate with FreePBX on an old HP mini netbook.  Can now send predictive dialers to Spam voice mail box, and send whitelist to our landline phones.

(Sources: [ObiTalk Forum: Using the Obi 110 as an FXO and FXS Port for FreePBX](http://www.obitalk.com/forum/index.php?topic=1157.msg7261#msg7261), [FreePBX Documentation wiki](https://wiki.freepbx.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4161594))

***OBIHAI OBI110 - setting up basic communications between OBI110 and FreePBX***

This document assumes that you have your OBI110 connected to your network and telephone jack, and you have installed [FreePBX 14 (with version 13 of Asterisk)](https://www.freepbx.org/downloads/) on a dedicated computer, which is connected to the same network.  The OBI110 ip address is 192.168.1.13, FreePBX is at 192.168.1.11, and your router is at 192.168.1.1.


**1. OBI110 Network Settings**

*Internet Settings*

	IPAddress	192.168.1.13 (requires static ip address)
	SubnetMask	255.255.255.0
	DefaultGateway	192.168.1.1 (ip address of your router)
	DNSServer1	192.168.1.1

---

***2. Configure Line Port***

Connection from wall telephone jack (rj11) to OBI110 to FreePBX [trunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunking).  

The [RJ11 jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack) is connected via a standard telephone cable to OBI110.  The OBI110 is then connected to your home LAN using Ethernet cable so that it can connect to your FreePBX server.

**2.a. OBI110 Line Port**

Physical Interfaces > LINE Port

	Enable			selected	
	DigitMap	        default		
	InboundCallRoute	SP2(5555551234)	
	
(SP2 = SP2 Service (under Voice Services).  It puts your telephone number in the SIP2 Inbound route on the OBITrunk1.  SP2 is configured on the OBI110.  Trunk and associated Inbound route is configured on FreePBX server).

**2.b. ITSP Profile B**
(ITSP = Internet Service Provider - i.e. FreePBX)

*General*

	Name		Line to SP2 to FreePBX Trunk
	DigitMap	default

Service Provider Info - defaults

*SIP*

	ProxyServer	192.168.1.13 (ip address of FreePBX server)

	X_SpoofCallerID - selected
	X_AccessList 	192.168.1.13 (only allow access to OBI110 from FreePBX server ip address)

FreePBX server port 5060 points to chan_sip on FreePBX in this configuration; (this is not a default FreePBX setting)

**2.c. Voice Services**

**SP2 Service**

	Enable			selected
	X_ServProvProfile	B (points to ITSP Profile B)

**3.e. FREEPBX Outbound Routes**

Your landline phone now has a route to the FreePBX server.  

To actually connect to FreePBX from your phone (via OBI110) you need to dial '**1'.  You can do this now.  

From here you can dial 300 to get the extension we create and leave a voice mail. 

Or, if you want to call someone as you normally would on a telephone, we need to tell FreePBX how to do this.  One way is to create a dial code that tells FreePBX to send your keypresses to the PSTN (Public Service Telephone Network).  This is how we create that code.

Connectivity > Outbound Routes

	Route Settings
		Route: 81DialsPOTS
		Trunk Sequence for Matched Routes: OBITRUNK1
		
	Dial Patterns
	
		81|
		81|1NXXNXXXXXX
		81|NXXNXXXXXX
		81|NXXXXXX
		81|X11
		
	Import/Export Patterns - not applicable
	
	Additional Settings - defaults

(POTS = Plain Old Telephone Service = PSNT)

***4. Whitelisting***

The Inbound Route on FreePBX decides what happens when someone calls your phone.  As part of the initial set up, we told FreePBX to send the call to extension 300, and since your phone is linked to this extension through OBI110, any call coming in will ring on your landline phone.

What can we do to prevent robo calls from making your phone ring?  

Spam callers usually use a [predictive dialer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_dialer) to connect you to their spam agent.  One way to stop this is to require anyone calling you to dial 8 before allowing the call to go through.  We can use the FreePBX IVR app to do this.

**4.a Record caller prompts**

First, we need to record our the messages we want the caller to hear.

Using an Audio recording app (such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)), record the following phrase:

	Hello, you've reached 555 555 1234, please press 8 to continue

and save it as a wav file named:

	greetingAndPressToContinue.wav

(note: if your browser supports it, you can record your prompt in your browser when adding a new recording - see: Admin > System Recordings, then 'Record in Browser')

**4.b Upload recording to FreePBX**

Next upload your wavefile to FreePBX

	Admin > System Recordings

Add New System Recording

	Name			greetingAndPressToContinue.wav
	Description		greeting and press key to Continue
	Upload Recording

**4.c Setup IVR**

on FreePBX: Application > IVR

	IVR Name 		PressToContinue
	IVR Description		Press key in order to continue 
	Announcement		greetingAndPressToContinue.wav
	Enable Direct Dial 	Disabled
