# Robocallblocker (work in progress)
Configurations for OBI110 and FreePBX/Asterisk block landline robocallers.
 
We have an old-school landline phone for home use and have been getting many SPAM calls. This is an approach to blocking those calls using an OBI110 [ATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_telephone_adapter) and [FreePBX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreePBX).  

It simply asks callers to press a key, and if they do, it then transfers the call to our regular [landline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landline) phone.  If no one answers, it sends the call to a good voice mail extension.  If they don't press a key, it sends the call to a SPAM voice mail.  A whitelist allows known callers bypass the IVR Spam filter altogether and ring your phone directly.

The ATA used in this document is an old OBI110 I had purchased a few years ago and finally got around to setting up to communicate with FreePBX on an old HP mini netbook.

***OBIHAI OBI110 - setting up basic communications between OBI110 and FreePBX***

This document assumes that you have your OBI110 connected to your network and telephone jack, and have installed [FreePBX 14 (with version 13 of Asterisk)](https://www.freepbx.org/downloads/) on a dedicated computer, which is connected to the same network as the OBI110.  

The OBI110 ip address is assumed to be 192.168.1.13, FreePBX is at 192.168.1.11, and your router is at 192.168.1.1.  Change this to reflect your network settings.  This document also assumes that your home phone number is 555-555-1234 - change this to your phone number.


**1. OBI110 Network Settings**

*Internet Settings*

	IPAddress	192.168.1.13 (requires static ip address)
	SubnetMask	255.255.255.0
	DefaultGateway	192.168.1.1 (ip address of your router)
	DNSServer1	192.168.1.1

---

***2. Configure Line Port***

Connection from wall telephone jack (rj11) to OBI110 to FreePBX [trunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunking).  

The [RJ11 jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack) is connected via a standard telephone cable to OBI110.  The OBI110 is then connected to your home LAN using Ethernet cable so that it can connect to your FreePBX server.

**2.a. OBI110 Line Port**

Physical Interfaces > LINE Port

	Enable			selected	
	DigitMap	        default		
	InboundCallRoute	SP2(5555551234)	
	
(SP2 = SP2 Service (under Voice Services).  It puts your telephone number in the SIP2 Inbound route on the OBITrunk1.  SP2 is configured on the OBI110.  Trunk and associated Inbound route is configured on FreePBX server).

**2.b. ITSP Profile B**
(ITSP = Internet Service Provider - i.e. FreePBX)

*General*

FreePBX server port 5060 points to chan_sip on FreePBX in this configuration; (this is not a default FreePBX setting)

**2.c. Voice Services**

**3.e. FREEPBX Outbound Routes**

Your landline phone now has a route to the FreePBX server.  

To actually connect to FreePBX from your phone (via OBI110) you need to dial '**1'.  You can do this now.  

From here you can dial 300 to get the extension we create and leave a voice mail. 

Or, if you want to call someone as you normally would on a telephone, we need to tell FreePBX how to do this.  One way is to create a dial code that tells FreePBX to send your keypresses to the PSTN (Public Service Telephone Network).  This is how we create that code.

Connectivity > Outbound Routes

	Route Settings
		Route: 81DialsPOTS
		Trunk Sequence for Matched Routes: OBITRUNK1
		
	Dial Patterns
	
		81|
		81|1NXXNXXXXXX
		81|NXXNXXXXXX
		81|NXXXXXX
		81|X11
		
	Import/Export Patterns - not applicable
	
	Additional Settings - defaults

(POTS = Plain Old Telephone Service = PSNT)

***4. Whitelisting***

The Inbound Route on FreePBX decides what happens when someone calls your phone.  As part of the initial set up, we told FreePBX to send the call to extension 300, and since your phone is linked to this extension through OBI110, any call coming in will ring on your landline phone.

What can we do to prevent robo calls from making your phone ring?  

Spam callers usually use a [predictive dialer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_dialer) to connect you to their spam agent.  What happens is that the Robocaller calls many nuumbers, and if someone answers, proceeds to try to match them with an available attendant.  But the robocallers are dumb, and if you ask them to press a digit, they cannot (not yet at least - voice spammers are beginning to use speech recogniion, more on that later...).

Therefore, to prevent roboCallers, you need require anyone calling you to dial 8 before allowing the call to go through.  We can use the FreePBX IVR app to do this.

**4.a Record caller prompts**

First, we need to record our the messages we want the caller to hear.

Using an Audio recording app (such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)), record the following phrase:

	Hello, you've reached 555 555 1234, please press 8 to continue

and save it as a wav file named:

	greetingAndPressToContinue.wav

(note: if your browser supports it, you can record your prompt in your browser when adding a new recording - see: Admin > System Recordings, then 'Record in Browser')

**4.b Upload recording to FreePBX**

Next upload your wavefile to FreePBX

	Admin > System Recordings

Add New System Recording

	Name			greetingAndPressToContinue.wav
	Description		greeting and press key to Continue
	Upload Recording

**4.c Setup IVR**

on FreePBX: Application > IVR

	IVR Name 		PressToContinue
	IVR Description		Press key in order to continue 
	Announcement		greetingAndPressToContinue.wav
	Enable Direct Dial 	Disabled
	Invalid Recording	Default

**5. Troubleshooting**

FreePBX uses [fail2ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban). If as you are setting up FreePBX and logging on and logging off you get locked out for no apparent reason, it is likely you have been caught by fail2ban.  

Go to Admin > System Admin

select: Intrusion Detection

Add the ip address of the computer you are using to remotely access the FreePBX server to the Whitelist section (you may have to do this from a different computer, or restart FreePBX - note you only have a minute or two before fail2ban blocks your ip address again).

Submit your change.
